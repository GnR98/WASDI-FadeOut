# Algorithm to detect and avoid waste of water nearby aqueducts
### FadeOut Software
#### The aim of the project is to develop an algorithm that, through the analysis of satellite images, is able to detect water leaks and consequentially reduce the waste. The algorithm will be developed using some machine learning technique in order to have, after a certain period of time, a fully autonomous software with a good precision.
