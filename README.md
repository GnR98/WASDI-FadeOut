# Algorithm to detect and avoid waste of water nearby aqueducts
## FadeOut Software
### The objective of the project that Fadeout Software is currently working on is to develope an algorithm that, through the analysis of satellite images, is able to detect water leaks and consequentially reduce the waste. The algorithm will be developed using some machine learning technique in order to have, after a certain period of time, a fully autonomous software with a good precision.

### In order to help we were given 2 tasks: the first is importing a new standard processing for satellite images on their platform and he second is correcting,filtering and improving the dataset that will be used to train the algorithm.
